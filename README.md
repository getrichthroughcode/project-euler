# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems found on Project Euler. All the code is written in the C language. It serves as a way for me to learn the syntax of C while solving interesting mathematical problems.

Feel free to use this code however you want. I hope that it will be helpful to you and aid in your understanding of both C programming and the mathematical concepts behind the Project Euler problems.
