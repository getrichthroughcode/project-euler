# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Initially, all the code was written in the C language as a way for me to learn its syntax while solving interesting mathematical problems. Now, I am expanding my knowledge by solving these problems in multiple programming languages, including C++, Go, and OCaml.

Feel free to use this code however you want. I hope that it will be helpful to you and aid in your understanding of various programming languages and the mathematical concepts behind the Project Euler problems.

## Languages Used
- C
- C++
- Go
- OCaml

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Learn more and try solving the problems yourself at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/getrichthroughcode/project-euler
2. Navigate to the directory of the language you want to explore and compile/run the solutions provided.
